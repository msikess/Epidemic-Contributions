The work that I contributed to the Epidemic game

*Note:

Since I do not own the game and it is still under development, with my creative rights I will publish only part of my work. However, even so I'll have to change certain things in order to not reveal the underlying model and private information that are involved.
Due to the above mentioned, it will take me some time to go through all the code and decide what I can or can not publish.
