The work that I contributed to the Epidemic game

*Note:

1) Since I do not own the game and it is still under development, with my creative rights I will publish only part of my work. However, even so I'll have to change certain things (mostly variable names) in order to not reveal the underlying model and private information that are involved.

2) I have gone through most of the code and only a couple more of my scripts remain.

3) Note that the game is still under development (we are working towards a Beta version) so the files are liable to change;
